<h1 style="font-size:40px" align="center">Welcome to the best Search-Tree of all time !</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px" align="center">Here you can see our greatest product which is our own Search-Tree!<br>
On it, you can find a list of consoles with their name and release date, and you can display it! Also, there is not enough consoles, so you can add some, so it has more data :)<br><br>
One more funny thing, you can play a small game! Not a AAA game sadly :(. But enough to test your knowledge on the release date of each console :D.<br><br>
</p>

You can compile and execute the program by running the `start.sh` file.
